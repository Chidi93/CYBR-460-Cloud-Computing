# CYBR 460 Cloud-Computing & Virtualization Project 1 Description


##Project 1 – Containerizing Applications with Docker
________________________________________
##Overview:
In this assignment, you will learn the practical skills of containerizing applications using Docker. You can choose to containerize an innovative project you have previously developed, one that was built to run on a specific platform with unique dependencies, or build a new application with platform-specific dependencies. The goal is to create a Dockerized application that runs independently of its host platform, thereby overcoming the challenges of environment-specific libraries or configurations.

##Objectives:
-Understand Containerization: Learn the fundamental concepts behind containers and how Docker abstracts application dependencies from the underlying operating system.
-Docker Proficiency: Gain hands-on experience with Dockerfiles, Docker images, and Docker containers.
-Platform Independence: Demonstrate how containerization allows an application to run seamlessly across different environments.
-Problem Solving: Modify an existing project to run in a platform-independent Docker container or develop a new application and package it for efficient deployment in any environment using Docker.


##Assignment Requirements:
###1.	Project Selection:
Option 1: Choose an innovative project you have previously developed that was built to run on a particular platform (e.g., Windows-specific libraries, Linux-specific utilities, etc.). Your task is to containerize this project so it can run on any platform supporting Docker.
Option 2: Develop a new application that relies on specific dependencies or libraries that traditionally restrict it to a certain platform. Then, use Docker to containerize the application.
###2.	Containerization Process:
-Create a Dockerfile: Write a Dockerfile that details the steps to build your application’s container image. Include installation of necessary dependencies and libraries.
-Build the Docker Image: Use the Dockerfile to build an image of your application.
-Run the Container: Demonstrate how to run your application within a container. Ensure that it starts up correctly and functions as expected.
-Documentation: Provide clear documentation on how to build, run, and test your containerized application.
###3.	Project Specifications:
-The application must include dependencies or libraries that, without containerization, would not run properly on platforms other than the one it was designed for.
-Clearly document any challenges you encountered and how containerization helped resolve them.
-Ensure your project is self-contained. Anyone with Docker installed should be able to clone your repository, build the image, and run your application without additional platform-specific configuration.

##Deliverables:
###1.	Source Code Repository: 
	-All source code including the Dockerfile, any configuration files, and the application code.
	A README file that includes: 
	-An overview of your project and its platform-specific dependencies.
	-Step-by-step instructions on how to build and run your Docker container.
	-Any additional setup or configuration details.
###2.	Demonstration Video: 
A short video (3-5 minutes) demonstrating your containerized application in action. This should include: 
-How to build the Docker image.
-How to run the container.
-An overview of the application functionality.
###3.	Detailed Report: 
####Write a 2–3-page report using the IEEE template available on the Course Canvas page detailing: 
-Your approach to containerizing the application.
-The Novelty of the Project.
-Working application with all screenshots.
-The challenges you encountered and how you addressed them.
-Insights on the benefits and limitations of containerization for platform-specific applications.

##Evaluation Criteria:
###Correctness and Completeness (40%): 
-Does the Dockerfile properly set up the application and all dependencies?
-Is the application fully containerized and does it run on any Docker-supported platform?
###Documentation and Clarity (30%): 
-Quality of the README file and instructions.
-Clarity of the reflection document
###Innovation and Problem-Solving (20%): 
-Creativity in overcoming platform-specific challenges.
-The application’s overall design and robustness.
###Video Demonstration (10%): 
-Clear and effective demonstration of the containerization process and application functionality.

##Submission Instructions:
-Submit all your files including docker files, ReadMe, detailed report, and video via the GitHub submission link. 
-Make sure all submission materials are organized and clearly labeled.

##Important Notes:
-Feel free to use external Docker tools or orchestration platforms (e.g., Docker Compose) if they add value to your project.
-Make sure to test your container on at least one platform different from your development environment.
-Reach out for clarification if any aspects of the assignment are unclear.
